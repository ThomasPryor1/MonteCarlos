This is my code for DAS2 Project 4

Name:Thomas Pryor

This program will take in 4 files "t1.txt", "t2.txt", "t3.txt" and "t4.txt" which has 5 numbers on them which are: 

-number of batches
-number of items in each batch
-percent of batches containing bad items
-percent of items that are bad in a bad batch
-items sampled in each batch

With this information the program generates data sets baised on the requirements given

It then tries to find with sets are bad and which are good within the generated sets which it prints out for each text file

This program takes no inputs and all that is needed to run is to type "./main" while in the folder on the command line




NOTE: This is meant to run on linux systems so there may be errors when running on a different os
